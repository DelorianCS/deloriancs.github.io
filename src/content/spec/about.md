Hi, I'm a cybersecurity student (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹/ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸), and I created this site to share my **HackTheBox** write-ups, certification experiences, blogs and so on â€” a platform where I spend most of my time learning, solving **CTFs**, and most importantly, having fun exploring new skills.

I also own the [Kurogen Guild](https://discord.gg/feaadNXQS9) which is a *offensive cybersecurity* guild where we focus on trying the latest *CTF challenges* and **HackTheBox** machines in group

Currently (2025) I'm attending High School while studying *red teaming* at the same time, by the next years I'm planning to obtain a *Cybersecurity Bachelors degree*.

&#x20;I hold the *Certified Professional Penetration Tester* (`eCPPT`) and the *Junior Penetration Tester* (`eJPT`) certifications, I've owned both of these certs in summer 2025 because of the free time I had and now I'm preparing for both `CRTP` and `CWES`.

> As I plan to keep going on achieving certs, this is my cert roadmap so far:
