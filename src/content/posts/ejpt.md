## eJPTv2 Review

**January 2025 • by DelorianCS**

My experience preparing for *INE's* *Junior Penetration Tester* `eJPTv2`: how I studied, what to focus on, what to skip, and tips for passing confidently as a beginner.

## My Background
I was essentially a beginner. My main experience came from **TryHackMe** labs, where I learned networking basics and cybersecurity fundamentals—enough to get started but nothing advanced.

## The Training
The official *INE*  training is well-structured and thorough, but it goes beyond what's needed for the exam itself. Focus on the essentials for efficiency.

### What to Skip
- *Phishing modules* (not exam-critical)
- *Some passive reconnaissance sections* (useful but not essential)
- *The web pentesting module* is largely unnecessary for the exam

## What to Add
Focus on fundamentals: **networking concepts**, **nmap scanning**, **FTP and SMB enumeration**, **Metasploit**, and common exploits like *EternalBlue*. Practice light TryHackMe machines for a balanced skill set.

## Preparation
Around **15–30 days** of focused study is enough to comfortably pass the test if you stay consistent. Perfect for those starting their cybersecurity journey.

## The Exam
The exam runs entirely in-browser through `Guacamole`, which feels different if you're used to a local **VM**. All required tools are provided, and you have **48 hours!!** that's plenty of time, as 5–6 hours is often enough.

## Personal Opinion
As it's my first certification I can't really add complains but I think this may be a little too beginner-friendly when it comes to the content, you do learn a lot on the course but the exam itself its so easy that it doesn't feel like all the learning was useful

## Exam Flaws / Caveats
1. Occasional lab instability—flags may vanish until a reset
2. Overall no real flaws with the exam itself

## Tips
1. Take detailed notes—hosts, credentials, footholds
2. Copy all exam questions into your notes (Obsidian is great)
3. If stuck, brute-force low-hanging services
4. Once you feel ready, take the exam without hesitation (trust me it's easy af)
5. Enjoy the process and have fun

### Quick Facts

- **Time**: 48-hour window (6 hours typical)
- **Focus**: Basic enumeration → exploitation → post-exploitation

**Bottom Line**: Perfect entry-level certification that builds solid foundational skills without overwhelming beginners. Highly recommended for starting your pentesting journey!
